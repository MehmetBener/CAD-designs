## Notes & Reflections

### Map of Türkiye
- Imported an image of the country using the **Canvas** feature.
- Drew the outline manually on a sketch plane.
- Used **Extrude** to give it depth and experimented with different heights.
- Learned how to align imported images and trace accurately.

### Keychain Tag
- Practiced applying **sketch constraints** to keep shapes controlled.
- Used **Text Tool** to engrave my name, then **Extruded** the cut.
- Added a 5 mm circular hole and applied **Fillets** to the corners.
- This was my first fabrication-ready design — could be printed directly.

### Perfume Bottle
- Designed with 8 main profile sketches across offset planes.
- Used **Loft** for an organic bottle shape.
- Learned the difference between **centerline** and **guide rails**.
