# CAD-Designs

This repository contains my personal Fusion 360 design portfolio. Each folder in the [Projects](./Projects) folder represents a standalone project made uniquely by me, while each folder in the [Learning Fusion](./Learning_Fusion) folder represents designs I made while following tutorials in my Fusion 360 learning journey.

## Design Log

See [`design-log.md`](./design-log.md) for development notes and reflections.
